# _"Choose - Track" - End of Week Two project_

#### _Practice using jQuery and branching_

#### By _**Chris Quattrocchi**_

## Description

_End of week two recap. Covers skills learned in jQuery, CSS and Bootstrap, as well as best practices using Git and the Terminal. This site uses 6 drop-down menus and a submit button to dynamically display relevant track info for epicodus. The sixth menu, pet preference, has no bearing on which track is displayed. "REACT" is used as the catch-all category to avoid nothing being displayed.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _clone repository_
* _extract zip file_
* _open index.html in a web browser compatible with jQuery 3.2.1_


## Known Bugs
